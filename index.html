Premises:
<p>
1. The objective of the test is to check if the proposed changes would increase signup and upgrade conversions. The idea therefore is to test changes that would reduce friction to the user. The way I have approached this decrease of friction is on the one hand reducing the number of steps in the signin and upgrade process. On the other hand I have tried to minimize the number of input fields as that is where the main friction exists.
<p>
2. The options are specified as how I would perform the A/B testing but their are not excluding. They could be combined as well.
<p>
3. I have some knowledge of html/css/js but I am far from being a professional desginer/pagemaker. So please do not consider the desgin aspects of the proposals but the idea behind.
<p>
4. Even not asked for, I have added some ideas to the "Upgrade to professional" page as I understand it is as important to get new users as getting these users to pay a subscription. These are more complex tests that need a third party. It depends on the PSP Zapier is using but most sure you are using Stripe or Braintree they surely provide connection with the methods I am proposing.

    <td>In this option the idea is to ask for the main data: name and email, directly in the zapbook page and skip the signup page. The customer would signin and be linked directly to his/her home page and already logged. As the customer has not yet set the password, it should be highlited to him/her with a popup, tooltip or similar. Aditionally, an email would be sent to his/her address with a link to set the password from there in case he/she forgets or leaves the initial session without setting the password. By skipping one step an increase in conversion should be appreciated.</td>

    <td><a href="zapbook/index_v2.html">zapbook option 2</a></td>
    <td>This option adds several social login possibilities. As many users have accounts in one or several of these services, it is very likely that they are logged in when they land in Zapier's zapbook page so the signup process in this case becomes very smooth. Besides, most of these services will provide the basic needed data as email address and full name so after granting permissions, we could forward the customer directly to his/her home page avoiding the signup page. The image with the signup options is clickable and leads to a Google Signup page. This page could be as well configured as a popup. Clicking on the gmail user that is already logged (yago.casasnovas@gmail.com) will lead directly to the user's home page.</td>

	In this option the password field has been removed and the idea is the same as in the zapbook option 1. The customer signs in directly and he/she can set the password afterwards either direclty in his/her profile or via a link sent to his/her email address.

    <td><a href="payment/index_v1.html">Option 1</a></td>
    <td>Even though not specifically asked for, I would suggest to include additional payment methods in the "Upgrade to professional" page. I would initially suggest two:<p>1. Paypal: It has several advantages. Companies are starting to use Paypal as an actual bank in the sense that they use the balance of the Paypal accounts from the collections to pay directly to suppliers without actually moving the money to traditional bank accounts. The second advantage is the possibility to make suscriptions. The two combined would allow a company to pay Zapier from their balance in Paypal. In Europe it has an additional advantage which is to link the Paypal account directly to the bank account without the need of a credit card.<p>2. SEPA Direct Debit: This I would recommend definitely for European customers. It allows suscriptions as well and the cost is a fixed rate of around 35 Euro cents per payment. It is very widespread around the Eurozone. The only drawback is that Zapier wolud need a non-resident European bank account (enough one account for all 27 members of the European Union.</td>
